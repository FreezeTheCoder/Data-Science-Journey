# Data-Science-Journey
This is a repository that contains a collection of how I have started learning Data Science from scratch using free sources on the web. I am uploading all the folders as and when I study for convenience.

**Contents**
1) Data Cleaning
2) Filling missing values using different techniques
3) Exploratory Data Analysis
4) Machine Learning Models -
   1) Linear Regression
   2) Logistic Regression

I will probably edit this description later, cause its 12:15 AM and I am super sleepy.
